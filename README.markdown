LV2.2
=====

Digital reconstruction of the [PSAS LV2.2](http://psas.pdx.edu/rockets/#lv22) rocket.


The workhorse of Portland State Aerospace Society, LV2.2 was successfully launched 7 times over 6 years. It's a good representation of a small university-class, low-altitude, commercial-solid-motor powered rocket.
